      <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p id="aboutmep"> Hi! Welcome to my site! My name is Paulina Minasi and I am from Westchester,
            New York. I'm a rising junior at Marist College and a Communication major with a concentration
            in Advertising and Public Relations. I have a Business minor and a Public Health pathway. I
            enjoy participating in events and activities held at my school. On campus, I am a part of many
            clubs such as Marist College Television (MCTV), Marist Public Relations Society (MCPRSSA),
            Italian club, Red Ink Club, and Habitat for Humanity. I am also a part of Marist College
            Dance Ensemble. I have taken dance classes since I was little and was part of a senior Dance
            company in high school. Some things I also enjoy are meeting new people, traveling, swimming,
            and playing with my dog!</p>

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
          <p id="mygoalsp"> My goal for this site is for people to view my projects and for
          potential employers to view my online portfolio of work. My projects created in
          different Adobe Creative Cloud softwares are very meaningful to me. I like to think that
          everything I create contains a part of me because it all derives from my imagination.
          I have always loved art and took art classes in all four years of high school. I was even
          Public Relations manager for the National Art Honors Society during those years. I love
          creating and turning my thoughts into projects, putting effort into everything I do. Therefore,
          this website represents who I am and work that conveys my mind into art form, which I am proud of.</p>
