      <h1>My Projects</h1>

      <div id="workdiv">
        <p id="workp"> <br> My projects and work featured on this page are all something I am proud to share.
            Each form of art took time to create, but was worth it in the end! I really enjoyed
            creating all of these projects. These are all my first creations using Adobe Creative Cloud
            software. I progressed as I learned using software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere.

          <h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
            <p id="photoshopp"> In Adobe Photoshop, I created three different compositions using different images.
                            The purpose was to demonstrate my ability to use different cut images to create compositions
                          by using different tools. The first composition is what I call the 'underwater window'. I wanted
                        to show what someone might see if they woke up and their house was underwater. It is one of my
                        favorite pieces I made. The second composition I created is the 'enchanted forest'. This shows a girl
                        holding a fairy in a bubble, which looks like they are communicating with each other. In the back,
                        a witch can be seen in the back lurking, seeming mysterious and dark. The third composition was more
                        fun, and it is called the 'colorful safari'. There is a pink giraffe and cotton candy trees. These
                        compositions were fun to make and I really enjoyed expressing my different ideas for imaginative
                        photos with stories behind them.</p>

      <div id="illustratordiv">
          <h2>Adobe Illustrator</h2>
            <p id="illustratorp"> In Adobe Illustrator, I created a logo for a fake brand. In this case, I used my name for
                        the fake brand/company. The goal was to demonstrate our abilities in different illustrator tools. For
                        the logo symbol design, I wanted it to be based off of a butterfly because they are a signififant symbol
                        in my life. To make it a logo, I wanted to incorporate my initials into the butterfly logo. This way, you
                        look at the logo and see a butterfly, but when taking a closer look, you can see the 'P' and 'M' initial.
                        The antena of the butterfly is also a 'M'. I made the logo purple and the colors fade from dark to light.
                        I also had to create a longer version of this logo, for the logo name. I spelled my full name and again
                        focused on the initials. The 'P' has a butterfly inside of it, while the top of the 'M'looks like a
                        butterfly as well. Both beginning initials are purple and shaded, similar to the symbol logo. Lastly, I
                        made a business card to show what the logos would look like professionally.</p>

          <h2>Adobe Premiere</h2>
            <p id="premierep"> In Adobe Premiere, I created a 59 second video compilation of my family vacation. The goal was to
                              show our abilities using premire tools like putting different effects and transitions, trimming clips,
                              and audio editing with two tracks. I used GoPro videos I captured while on vacation in 2018. My family
                              and I traveled to Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Lake Powell, and other places. There
                              were so many great views and things to see. We did fun activities, like hiking, which is featured in
                              the video. The video showcases the highlights of each place we went to. The video was required to be
                              less than one minute, so I picked the clips I wanted carefully. There were lots of amazing videos I
                              captured of mountains and nature that I could have included. In the future, I would definitely edit
                              another video with more clips from this trip! I loved this project because I can now look back on my
                              memories! </p>
